# 9. Distributed Computing & Spark with Azure Databricks

## 9.1 Introduction to Distributed Computing & Spark with Azure Databricks
The distributed computing & Spark with Azure Databricks introduction presentation is available [here](https://github.com/sebastianbirk/datascience-bootcamp/blob/main/content/09_distributed_computing_%26_spark_with_azure_databricks/09_distributed_computing_%26_spark_with_azure_databricks.pptx).

With Avanade being an official partner of Databricks, the best place for Avanadees to learn about distributed computing & Spark with Azure Databricks is the [Databricks Partner Academy](https://partner-academy.databricks.com/learn).
Another good resource especially for new features are the recent Data + AI summits (one of the biggest AI conferences in the world hosted by Databricks) which are made available on demand, such as the [Data+AI summit 2022](https://databricks.com/de/dataaisummit/).

## 9.2 Distributed Computing & Spark with Azure Databricks Lab

- We will create a Databricks workspace in our Azure subscription and clone this repository to Databricks Repos.
- Next, we will create a cluster with 11.1 ML Databricks runtime (no GPU; 1 min worker; 2 max workers).
- We can now use that cluster to go through the notebooks 'Intro to DF Part 1', 'Intro to DF Part 2' and 'ML 04 - MLflow'.

## 9.3 Summary Remarks

Congratulations! You have come a long way and have learned about Spark, the dominating technology to process big data. You now know what Spark is, how its architecture looks like and how you can make use of Spark with Azure Databricks. Happy big data wrangling!
