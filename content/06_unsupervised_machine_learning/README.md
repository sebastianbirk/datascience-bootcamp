# 6. Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 6.1 **Overview**

The main goal of unsupervised learning algorithms is to discover hidden patterns from unlabeled data. In contrast to supervised learning, there are no output variables (target) to predict for unsupervised learning.
This session will introduce unsupervised machine learning, which include the implementation of preparing data ready for applying unsupervised machine learning methods, and some popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

## 6.2 **What you will learn**
  - Learn how a machine discover patterns from data
  - Use the Scikit-Learn library to deploy unsupervised learning models and see results
  - Evaluate multiple clustering results
  
## 6.3 **Prerequisites**
This session assumes familiarity with Jupyter Lab and basics of python and libraries like pandas and matplotlib.
 
## 6.4 **Getting started**
To get your environment set up and access the data and notebook, make sure you have Conda and Git installed. Then simply run the following:

- To enter the working directory: **cd datascience-bootcamp**
- To extract recent files from github: **git pull**
- To activate the desired environment in a Unix environment:  **conda activate datascience-bootcamp**
- To launch Jupyter Lab: **jupyter lab --no-browser**
